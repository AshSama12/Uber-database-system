# Uber-database-system
Database system for Uber using PHP as a university project.
This project is a PHP-based implementation of a database for an Uber-like application. 
It aims to provide a foundation for managing user data, ride information, and other essential components of a ride-sharing platform.

Here I used Mysql and PHP, and here we can add, edit, and delete options. Driver Details also included.
